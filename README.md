# Protocol5
Immplementation of Go-back-n protocol 

Protocol 5 (Go-back-n) allows multiple outstanding frames. The sender may transmit up
to MAX SEQ frames without waiting for an ack. In addition, unlike in the previous
protocols, the network layer is not assumed to have a new packet all the time. Instead,
the network layer causes a network layer ready event when there is a packet to send.
